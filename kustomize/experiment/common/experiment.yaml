# - match query instead of index?
# -- Why watch? Simply fetch and check weightFieldRefs?
# -- More slow detection?

# -- additional sanity check with conditions on the object?

# What if the pods are not ready yet? What if the pods had failed?

# — State of the object can change in the middle of the experiment?
# — RBAC

# How will users use it / sanity check / 

# Subresources => changes to CR.
